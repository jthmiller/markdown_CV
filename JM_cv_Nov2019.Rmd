# EDUCATION AND APPOINTMENTS:

_University of Minnesota_\, Postdoctoral Scholar \hfill January 2019-Current

  * Advisor: Suzanne McGaugh

_University of California, Davis_\, Ph.D., Pharmacology and Toxicology \hfill December 2018

  * Advisor: Andew J. Whitehead

_Saint Cloud State University_\, MS, Cell and Molecular Biology \hfill May 2011

  * Advisor: Heiko Schoenfuss

_Minnesota State University Moorhead_\, BA, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology \hfill May 2009

  * Advisor: Brian D. Wisenden

# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:

Postdoctoral Scholar - University of Minnesota, Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior

  * _Research: Identification of the premature termination codons and molecular mechanisms that contribute to cave and surface populations of Astyanax mexicanus._\ Analysis includes multiple population whole-genome sequences and gene expression profiles to associate genetic variation with cavefish phenotypes.

Graduate Research - University of California Davis, Department of Environmental Toxicology

  * _Dissertation: Mapping the Genetic Basis of Rapid Evolution to Industrial Pollutants in Atlantic Killifish._\ Conducted a comparative analysis of genome structure of killifish and other sequenced vertebrates. Used a quantitative genomic approach to determine the architecture of rapidly evolved resistance to the teratogenicity of pollutants in coastal killifish populations.

Graduate Research - Saint Cloud State University, Department of Biology

  * _Thesis: Contribution of Wastewater to Endocrine Distruption in Minnesota Rivers._\ Developed tools and conduct analyses to determine the contribution of environmental variation and endocrine disruptors on the behavior and physiology (protein expression) of fish.

Undergraduate Research - Minesota State University Moorhead, Biosciences Department

  * _Research: Chemical ecology of alarm-cues in freshwater fish._\ Designed and conducted field and laboratory trials to determine if _Umbra limi_ skin extract ellicits anti-predator behavior.
